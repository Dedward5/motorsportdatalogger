# Motor Sport Data Logger
A racing car data logger based on the Raspberry Pi Sense hat

This is for a NON ODB based vehicle. The intention is to initialy only use the SenseHat based inputs to record data for a racing car being used for Sprint and Hillclimb racing, however it could apply to general track use. Later on I might work on some basic hardware to do RPM, brake pedal and maybe more.

# Credits
To get started I drew heavily on the code examples here
https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/sense-hat-data-logger/worksheet/

# Documentation
Please __read the docs__ in the ../docs folder to find out how to install and use the datalogger
